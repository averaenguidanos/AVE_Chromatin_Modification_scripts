# M_1: Extracted from "COUNTS OF 1".
# M_2: Extracted from "OBSERVED COUNTS" for 2.
# M_DISTINCT: Extracted from "DISTINCT READS"
# Total number of reads: Extracted from "TOTAL READS".

# These values are used to calculate the following ENCODE ChIP-seq quality metrics:

# PCR Bottlenecking Coefficient 1 (PBC1): PBC1 = M_1 ÷ M_DISTINCT = "COUNTS OF 1" ÷ "DISTINCT READS"
# PCR Bottlenecking Coefficient 2 (PBC2): PBC2 = M_1 ÷ M_2 = "COUNTS OF 1" ÷ "OBSERVED COUNTS" for 2
# Non-Redundant Fraction (NRF): NRF = The number of distinct uniquely mapping reads (i.e., the number after removing duplicates) ÷ the total number of reads = "DISTINCT READS" ÷ "TOTAL READS"
